PROJECT TITLE:
Distributed Multi-Source Operational Analytics System

OBJECTIVE:
To design and implement a complete end-to-end analytics pipeline integrating SQL Server, MySQL, and Power BI to monitor, analyze, and visualize distributed operational and inventory performance.

DATA SOURCES:
1. SQL Server – Test Environment Inventory Dataset
2. SQL Server – Product Master Dataset
3. MySQL – Production Environment Inventory Dataset

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- SQL Server 2019
- MySQL 8
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query (M)
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

CORE TASKS COMPLETED:
1. Data ingestion from SQL Server and MySQL using native connectors.
2. Data cleansing, deduplication, and schema alignment.
3. Merging test, production and product master datasets using joins.
4. Creating unified dimensional model for analytical reporting.
5. Building automated refresh pipelines with Power BI.
6. Designing operational dashboards using DAX KPIs.

KEY METRICS DEVELOPED:
- Total Stock (Test + Prod)
- Stock Variance
- Item Availability %
- Category-Level Inventory Distribution
- Environment Comparison Metrics
- Movement/Adjustment Logs
- Cost Deviations Across Environments

DAX MEASURES:
